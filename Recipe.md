The recipe required to make blueberry pancakes is:

Step 1 - 
Mix the milk and vinegar and let it sit for a minute or two.

Step 2 -
Whisk the dry ingredients together. Whisk the egg, milk, and melted butter into the dry ingredients until just combined.

Step 3 -
Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Melt a little smear of butter in the pan (essential for giving a yummy golden brown crust).

Step 4 - 
Pour about 1/3 cup of batter into the hot skillet and spread it flat-like.  Arrange a few blueberries on top. Cook until you see little bubbles on top and the edges starting to firm up. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the pancakes are sky-high fluffy and cooked through.

Step 5 -
Serve with butter and maple syrup.

Additional Notes:

Texture: For thick pancakes, use 3/4 cup milk as directed. For lighter, slightly less fluffy pancakes, use 1 cup milk.

Dairy Free: Use almond milk or another non-dairy milk, and melted coconut oil in place of the butter.

That's it. Enjoy the yummy pancakes!
